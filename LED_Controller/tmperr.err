WARNING:Cpld - Unable to retrieve the path to the iSE Project Repository. Will
   use the default filename of 'top.ise'.
INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'RESET' based upon the LOC
   constraint 'P1'. It is recommended that you declare this BUFG explicitedly in
   your design. Note that for certain device families the output of a BUFG
   constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint will be
   ignored.
WARNING:Cpld:1239 - The global clock designation (BUFG) on signal 'RESET_IBUF'
   is ignored. Most likely the signal is gated and therefore cannot be used as a
   global control signal.
ERROR:Cpld:1063 - Design requires at least 68 macrocells, exceeds device limit
   64.
ERROR:Cpld:1064 - Design rules checking error. Fitting process stopped.
ERROR:Cpld:868 - Cannot fit the design into any of the specified devices with
   the selected implementation options.
